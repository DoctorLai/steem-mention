# SteemMention
Another mention tool for steemit is coming.

### Why To Develop It
I tried serveral tools about getting replies before.
But NO ONE is stable. So I make it again and give a 
sample way to deploy it by yourself.

### How To Deploy It
#### Requirement
* Nginx
* PHP7.1+
* Composer
* Mysql
* Python3
* [SteemPython](https://github.com/Netherdrake/steem-python)

#### Steps
1. Get the code to your host.
```
$ git pull https://github.com/ety001/steem-mention.git
```
2. Install the requirements by composer
```
$ cd steem-mention
$ composer install
```
3. Edit `Mysql connection information` and `SMTP configuration` in the `.env` file
```
DATABASE_URL=mysql://YOUR_DB_USERNAME:YOUR_DB_USER_PASS@YOUR_DB_HOST:3306/steem_mention
MAILER_URL=smtp://YOUR_MAIL_HOST:25?encryption=&auth_mode=login&username=YOUR_USERNAME&password=PASSWORD
SYS_EMAIL=notice@steem-mention.com # Set the system email
```
4. Update database schemata
```
$ php bin/console doctrine:schema:update --force
```
5. Run the block watcher
```
$ export API_URL=YOUR_HOST_URL/api/block/watcher  # set the api_url in watcher
$ python3 watcher/bots.py # run the watcher
```
